ActiveMerchantTesting
=====================

This is an early stage plugin replacement for ActiveMerchant's authorize_net_gateway and authorize_net_cim_gateway for use in testing.  It's not complete, just does what I needed it to do (which should be most of the gateway, cim-gateway functionality).

Example
=======

This, of course, depends on active merchant so, if you haven't already

  script/plugin install git://github.com/Shopify/active_merchant.git

Grab the plugin

  script/plugin install git://github.com/wiseleyb/active_merchant_testing.git


In your config/environments/test.rb add something like this:

  ActiveMerchant::Billing::Base.gateway_mode = :test
  CIMGATEWAY = ActiveMerchant::Billing::AuthorizeNetCimGatewayTest.new
  GATEWAY = ActiveMerchant::Billing::AuthorizeNetGatewayTest.new

Then, in your code, just use the gateway's as normal...

  response = CIMGATEWAY.gateway.delete_customer_profile(:customer_profile_id => 1234)

  response = GATEWAY.capture(dollar_amount, transaction_key)
