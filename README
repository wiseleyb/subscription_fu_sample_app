1) Setup your config/database.yml
2) rake db:create
3) rake db:migrate
4) get an auth.net test account at  http://developer.authorize.net/testaccount/  
5) copy authorize_net.yml.example and fill in your login/password.
6) add authorize_net.yml to .gitignore
7) look at development.rb - choose mocked object or auth.net's test gateway (can be slow but is a better way to test)


GOTCHA's

CSV - I don't have CSV in the CC form because, as far as I can tell, if you use it to setup a cim profile 
you then have to send the CSV with every transaction that follows.  Auth.net's CIM system won't store the CSV
value and it's against their terms of service to store it your self.  This kind of defeats the purpose of
a recurring billing system (forcing the user to enter this data everytime since you'll likely be doing billing
via cron)
